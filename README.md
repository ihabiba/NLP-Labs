# 🧠 Natural Language Processing Labs

This repository contains my lab works for the **Natural Language Processing** course at **Albukhary International University (AIU)**.  
Each lab explores key NLP techniques using **Python**, **NLTK**, and **spaCy**.

---

## 📘 Overview
Natural Language Processing (NLP) focuses on teaching computers to understand and process human language.  
These labs show how to transform unstructured text into structured, meaningful data through different NLP stages.

## 🧩 Lab Contents

| **Lab** | **Title / Topic** | **Description** |
|----------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Lab 1** | Building NLP Pipeline (Text Preprocessing) | Implemented tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, stop word removal, POS tagging, dependency parsing, and named entity recognition. |
| **Lab 2** | Understanding & Analyzing Words, Phrases, and Clauses | Covered phrase chunking with NLTK, clause identification with spaCy, and hierarchical syntax trees. |
| **Lab 3** | Feature Engineering: Converting Text into Numerical Representations | Implemented one-hot encoding, N-grams, TF-IDF, and trained word embeddings (CBOW & Skip-gram) with T-SNE visualization.  |
| **Lab 4** | Text Classification with Machine Learning | Implemented text cleaning and preprocessing, applied Bag-of-Words and TF-IDF vectorization, trained multiple classifiers (Naive Bayes, SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest), and evaluated their performance on spam and news classification tasks. |
| **Lab 5** | Text Summarization: Extractive & Abstractive Methods | Implemented TextRank and LexRank for extractive summarization, built an Encoder–Decoder Seq2Seq model for abstractive summarization, and evaluated results using ROUGE metrics. |
| **Lab 6** | *To be updated* |  |
| **Lab 7** | *To be updated* |  |
