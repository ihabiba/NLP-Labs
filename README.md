# 🧠 Natural Language Processing Labs

This repository contains my lab works for the **Natural Language Processing** course at **Albukhary International University (AIU)**.  
Each lab explores key NLP techniques using **Python**, **NLTK**, and **spaCy**.

---

## 📘 Overview
Natural Language Processing (NLP) focuses on teaching computers to understand and process human language.  
These labs show how to transform unstructured text into structured, meaningful data through different NLP stages.

## 🧩 Lab Contents

| **Lab** | **Title / Topic** | **Description** |
|----------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Lab 1** | Building NLP Pipeline (Text Preprocessing) | Implemented tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, stop word removal, POS tagging, dependency parsing, and named entity recognition. |
| **Lab 2** | Understanding & Analyzing Words, Phrases, and Clauses | Covered phrase chunking with NLTK, clause identification with spaCy, and hierarchical syntax trees. |
| **Lab 3** | Feature Engineering: Converting Text into Numerical Representations | Implemented one-hot encoding, N-grams, TF-IDF, and trained word embeddings (CBOW & Skip-gram) with T-SNE visualization. |
| **Lab 4** | Text Classification with Machine Learning | Implemented text cleaning and preprocessing, applied Bag-of-Words and TF-IDF vectorization, trained multiple classifiers (Naive Bayes, SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest), and evaluated their performance on spam and news classification tasks. |
| **Lab 5** | Text Summarization: Extractive & Abstractive Methods | Implemented TextRank and LexRank for extractive summarization, built an Encoder–Decoder Seq2Seq model for abstractive summarization, and evaluated results using ROUGE metrics. |
| **Lab 6** | Topic Modeling and Text Classification | Applied Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling on the 20 Newsgroups dataset and integrated topic distributions into a supervised text classification pipeline with performance evaluation and interpretation. |
| **Lab 7** | Text Clustering with Unsupervised Learning | Implemented text clustering using TF-IDF features with K-Means and Agglomerative (Hierarchical) Clustering, applied PCA for dimensionality reduction, and visualized clustering results on the 20 Newsgroups dataset. |
| **Lab 8** | Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Translation | Implemented multi-language text translation using Google Translate API and converted translated text into speech using gTTS, with options for automatic translation to all supported languages or user-selected language conversion and audio file download. |
| **Lab 9** | LLM-based NLP Application | Implemented a menu-driven NLP application using multiple LLMs (FLAN-T5, BART, GPT-2) to compare text generation, summarization, and question answering. Demonstrated how model training objectives affect output quality, control, and reliability. |
